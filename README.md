# draft# dynamic-survey-form


This project presents a dynamic survey form using C# and Python, where the next question is shaped based on the user's previous answer. This creates a customized survey experience unique to each user.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to dynamically adjust the survey content based on the user's responses. This approach ensures that users interact only with relevant questions, making the survey experience more personalized. At the end, a result is generated based on the answers provided by the user.

Features
Dynamic Question Flow: The next question is determined based on the response to each preceding question.
Easy Management and Updates: Using Python or C#, survey questions can be easily modified and managed with simple code structures.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a terminal-based survey experience that is simple and easy to use.
Technologies Used
C#: Presents the survey as a C# terminal application.
Python: Presents the survey as a Python terminal application.
